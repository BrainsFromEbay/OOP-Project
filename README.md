This project is a small battle app made in Android Studio.

The project might look like it's still in progress, because it is. Although it does have the basic functionality and it is somewhat usable.

So far the use can:
  1. Create Lutemons
  2. Train Lutemons
  3. Battle Lutemons

Additional features are abilities and their status effects. So far only a few Lutemon's can apply status effects, which affect the damage done and taken

When the user launches the app, they can create Lutemons by pressing the "Create" button at the bottom. Then they can choose the color and name of the Lutemon.
Next they can either train or battle with them. During battle, a Lutemon can use an ability only once. The defeated Lutemon is removed and the surviving Lutemon
is returned to the home screen.

Extra features that I have implemented are:
  1. RecyclerView (in home) +1
  2. Randomness in battles (based on statusEffect) +1
  3. Abilities and status effects (own features) +some points
